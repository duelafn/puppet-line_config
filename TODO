Items are roughly in order of interest. Help or patches implementing any of
these would be very much appreciated!


* RENAME(?): stdlib has renamed whole_line to file_line... :(
  https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib
  Or else attempt to modify and merge this code into stdlib


* tests


* backups (filebuckets or extension, just as in file type)


* mode and ownership settings?
  Is this possible without resorting to excessive providers: ini-windows,
  ini-posix, ...?


* Multi-line inserts?
  For monkey-patching system scripts, etc


* ensure => "comment"
  takes whatever was found and comments it


* Control placement of new lines?

  add => [ before, 'mousewheel\.withcontrolkey\.action' ],
